We initially came up with the decision of doing a matrix for the board so we could have a simple working game first. However, this comes with futuer complications such as converting the matrix to the graphic of board correspondinly. We expected this but still decided to went with this decision, which is why it is in the prudent and deliberate quadrant."

Because of how clueless I was, it was in the reckless and inadvertent quadrant."
